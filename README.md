# Written Report for the Movies_ETL Project

## Overview of Movies_ETL Challenge 

- Through this module we are working with Britta to Extract, Transform and Load(ETL), data gathered through both Wikipedia and Kaggle. We prepare tailored dataframes and csvs for Amazing Prime to use. 
### Purpose

- The purpose of this challenge was to create dataframes with the data we pulled. 

## Analysis and Challenges

- We first pulled the data from Wikipedia and Kaggle, using the data provided we are able to create some unclean dataframes.
- Next step was filtering out and cleaning the data we gathered 
- We are then able to provide presentable data to our client Amazing Prime to use.  
### Analysis of Outcomes 

- After we created the functions to clean and run the data we are able to trasnform it into a more readable form. 
- Setting up the dataframe for the coloumns we are able to remove any unnessasary categories. 
- After removing the uncessasary and unclean data we are able to create our database and use that for any further analysis.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- The main difficulty I encountered throughout this challenge was setting up correct DataFrames with the correct lables, there is just a lot to write and the combination of SQL and pandas was different from what we have encountered so far.
